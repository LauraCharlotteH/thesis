    <h1>Cookie Statement</h1>
    <p>
      As stated in our Privacy Policy, Wikimedia believes strongly in the values of privacy and transparency. To that end,
      we’ve created this Cookie Statement as a clear reference guide to the use of cookies on Wikimedia Sites. This Cookie
      Statement explains how we use cookies (and other locally stored data technologies), how we use third-party cookies,
      and how you can manage your cookie options. For more information on our privacy practices, please visit our Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, actively collects some types
      of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript,
      and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage.
    </p>
    <!--TODO Contents Menu -->
    <h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
    <p>A “cookie” is a tiny data file that we transfer onto your computer, mobile phone, or any other device that you use
      to access the Wikimedia Sites, and is generally used for authentication and tracking. Every cookie expires after a
      certain period of time, but that period varies depending on what the cookie is used for and how your browser is
      configured. </p>
    <p>Cookies are often categorized based on how long they remain active before they expire. A “session” cookie is one
      that generally expires when you close your web browser or mobile application. A “persistent” cookie is one that
      remains in your device, even after you close your browser or mobile application. A persistent cookie expires
      according to the duration set by us, or when you delete it manually. You can learn more about cookies on
      Wikipedia. </p>
    <p>You may remove or disable cookies through your browser settings. For more information on how to manage your cookie
      options, please see Section 3 of this Cookie Statement below.</p>
    <p>For more information on this and other key terms that may be relevant, please read through our Privacy Policy
      Glossary. </p>

    <h2>What types of cookies does Wikimedia use and for what purposes?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are not required in order to read or edit the Wikimedia Sites. We use the information we receive from
      cookies and other locally-stored data technologies to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and
      better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and interactions with the Wikimedia Sites, and to
      generally improve our services. Cookies are required in order to login and for your edits to be associated to a user
      account; without cookies, your edits will be anonymous and unassociated with an account. </p>
    <p>We use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels, and other locally-stored data technologies to accomplish different
      purposes. Below is a list of the categories of cookies we use and what they are used for. </p>
    <p><b>Functionality:</b></p>
    <p>These cookies help the Wikimedia Sites work and are essential in order to enable you to move around the Wikimedia
      site and use their features. These cookies are useful for remembering your username in the login field, maintaining
      your session and remembering previous actions, keeping you logged in (if selected), and more. </p>

    <p><b>Preferences:</b></p>
    <p>These cookies store your preferences, so that they can be remembered the next time you use the Wikimedia Sites, for

    <p>These cookies count the number of visitors and collect information about how you use the Wikimedia Sites. This
      allows us to better understand your user experience on the Wikimedia Sites and helps us improve them for you and

      <li>remembering the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you;</li>

    <p><b>Third-Party:</b></p>
    <p>We will never use third-party cookies on our wikis unless we get your permission to do so. These cookies would
      allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as “like” and “share” buttons. When a third party
      provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services. </p>
    <p>If you ever come across a third-party cookie transferred to your device during your access of the Wikimedia wiki
      sites, where you did not take any action to authorize the use and/or transfer of that cookie (such as one that may
      have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report that cookie to us at
      privacy@wikimedia.org. </p>
    <p><b>A note about Wikimedia sites hosted by WordPress:</b></p>
    <p>Some non-wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites are hosted by a third-party service provider, WordPress VIP. These sites
      may have the WordPress Stats module enabled. Stats is a service that allows us to understand how many visitors we
      get to our WordPress-hosted non-wiki sites, their location by country, and which pages, posts and links are the most
      popular. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider, Automattic/WordPress, have access to the raw Stats
      data, which is retained for a maximum of 30 days. For more information about Stats, see WordPress’ support page on
      the module. </p>
    <h2>What are my cookie options?</h2>
    <p>While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and
      other locally-stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally-stored data technologies may
      not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them. </p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>remove or disable specific locally-stored data on your browser’s settings (you can reset your web browser to
        refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent);
      </li>
      <li>use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or</li>
      <li>install a plug-in to block locally-stored data, if one is available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Turning off the browser’s cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking
      pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you
      do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and
      that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.
    </p>
    <h2>Where can I find more information?</h2>
    <p>Please read through our Privacy Policy for more information. If you have any further questions, contact
      privacy@wikimedia.org. </p>
