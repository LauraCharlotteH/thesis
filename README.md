This application is an Ionic Angular application used in an experiment. Participants are asked to complete the OPLIS Survey and then set cookies on seven fake pages. Depending on the selected participant group and OPLIS score the user interface for the cookie setting changes as detailed in the graph below.

It currently supports desktop only, as the responsive design features have been compromised.
